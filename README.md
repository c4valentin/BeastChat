# BeastChat
This app has not been published and therefore still needs the node-server to be ran along side the app. The link to this server is here
https://github.com/c4valentin/BeastChatSever. After the server is ran, all that is left is to replace the IP_LOCAL_HOST string inside constants
to your own local host IP address.
